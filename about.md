OuiShare Labs is an emerging network of web developers, app and platform makers within and around the global [OuiShare community](http://ouishare.net).

It was started in 2013 by OuiShare Connectors [Maxime Lathuili√®re]() and [Elf Pavlik](), who organised the first annual [OuiShare Labs Camp](/events/ouishare-labs-camp-1/) after OuiShare Fest 2013.
