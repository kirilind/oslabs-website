On Virtual Assembly, 4 types of profiles can be created :

- Actors : Individuals and groups
- Ideas : Critical or constructive, local or general.
- Resources : Good &amp; services, finances, places, best practices ... 
- Projects : Imagined or in progress

Actors, ideas and projects are the "building blocks" of Virtual Assembly. The network allows them to bind and structure themselves, facilitating the emergence of transition systems.
