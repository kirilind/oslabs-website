Gatesense is a collaborative platform to share data from devices and sensors (Internet of Things).

On the Gatesense platform you can share and build on data that empowers people to boldly experiment and accomplish things that would otherwise be impossible. Besides the existing relational database for data sharing we wish also to develop a P2P distributed database for everyone to collect and share their data and build their own applications... either using shared data or to generate new valuable data through IoT devices and sensors.
