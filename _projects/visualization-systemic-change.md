title: Visualizations for Systemic Change
meta: Conceiving practical tools for learning and information, keeping track of knowledge as well as material flows, tools that can help cultural interoperability and meaningful contextualized productive discussions toward transformative action and systemic change. Working towards a distributed web where people, information, knowledge can be fluidly assembled, disassembled and reassembled around objects of attention.

How parts of a whole can see the whole evolve and the relationships between parts in action, where gaps can be identified, needs fulfilled, possibilities explored and impacts visualized.

**Giving participants of a community a live perception of the whole in various dimensions** (not only social graph). 

[Holopticism such as illustrated by JF Noubel](http://wiki.thetransitioner.org/English/Holopticism): "Each player, thanks to his/her experience and expertise, relates to the whole in order to adjust his/her actions and coordinate them with others' moves. Therefore there is an unceasing round trip, a feedback loop that works like a mirror between the individual level and the collective one."

**Finding overlaps and relations between object and identify synergies across multiple dimensions** (it can be across disciplines, domains, projects, cultures, communities, interests...)

[Borderspaces and borderlinks such as described by Bracha Ettinger here](http://www.theoldbrandnew.nl/knowledge.html): borderspaces at the junction of things, borderlinks created via fluctuation of distance in proximity to create relations without relationships, where traces produced are shearable between subjects in trans-subjective relationships -start at 10'
 
**Enabling navigation of the adjacent possible, discovery and learning** 
  
[Exploring the adjacent possible linked data exploration graph requirements ](https://github.com/HeleneFi/linked-data-exploration-graph) that bring to life the 'adjacent possible' proposed by Struart Kaufman: "The strange and beautiful truth about the adjacent possible is that its boundaries grow as you explore them. Each new combination opens up the possibility of other new combinations. Think of it as a house that magically expands with each door you open. You begin in a room with four doors, each leading to a new room that you haven't visited yet. Once you open one of those doors and stroll into that room, three new doors appear, each leading to a brand-new room that you couldn't have reached from your original starting point. Keep opening new doors and eventually you'll have built a palace." Stephen Johnson, The Origins of Good Ideas, WSJ Sept 2011.
