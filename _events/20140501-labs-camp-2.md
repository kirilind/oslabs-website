###About Labs Camp###

OuiShare Labs Camp is a free pop-up hub uniting developers and visionaries in the global social web and collaborative economy communities. We come together for four days of connecting, coding and creating. The Camp will feature keynotes, project pitches and work sessions proposed by participants.
<!--break-->
Presented projects will be mapped, described and showcased on the third day of OuiShare Fest, May 7th, at the Cabaret Sauvage during the [OuiShare Fest Sharing Fair](http://ouisharefest.com/program#_sharing_fair). During the Camp we will also be building tools that facilitate ongoing connecting and co-creation throughout the year - that is, this website and anything else you want to come up with.

###Schedule###

Most of the agenda will be co-created at the beginning of each day. We will have a keynote (or two) on some mornings, followed by Open Space work sessions proposed by participants. At the end of each day we will gather and review what has been done. There will also be a short session of project pitches (3 minutes each) once or twice a day.

1 May - start at 09:00 with opening the doors, check-in, morning coffee, tea. Bring your breakfast if you want!
